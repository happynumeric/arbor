# Arbor 

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/happynumeric/arbor?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/happynumeric/arbor/releases/latest)

A simple command-line tool for Windows to generate a visual, text-based representation of a directory structure.
It is inspired by commands like `tree` in Linux or `dir /s` in Windows, but with more visual output and convenient filtering options.
The result is saved to a `tree.txt` file, ideal for project documentation, archives, or sharing folder structure.

### Example Output:
```
/my-project/  
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ js/ 
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js 
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js
```
## Main Features
- **Graphical Tree Output**: Displays a clear structure with connectors. 
- **Plain Text List**: An option `/t` to generate a simple list of file paths. 
- **File Filtering**: Include only files matching specific patterns (e.g., `*.py`, `*.md`). 
- **Standalone Executable**: `arbor.exe` is a single file that runs without needing Python installed. 
- **Built-in Help**: Comprehensive help system (`arbor /?`) and version command (`arbor /v`).
